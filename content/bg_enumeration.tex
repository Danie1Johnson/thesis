\section{Known Enumerative Results}

When treating the Building Game for a polyhedron as a stochastic process, we must first compute the combinatorial configuration space exactly. This is a computational enumeration problem, but the results of this enumeration are also of mathematical interest outside its stochastic use.

Attachment models like the Building Game have been the topic of much research in combinatorial mathematics. A well known example of this is the study of polyominoes. An $n$-omino is a configuration of $n$ attached squares in a $2$-dimensional lattice. As seen in figure~\ref{fig:Tetris}, the classic video game Tetris uses each of the seven rotationally unique tetrominoes ($n = 4$) as game pieces. The enumeration of $n$-ominoes has been extensively studied and there are many enumeration results, both explicit and asymptotic. As in our case, the general goal is to enumerate the polyominoes that are unique when acted on by some group (rotation, reflection, etc) or under certain constraints which are often topological.

%While the original Building Game paper does illustrate many icosahedral intermediates, Wales defines the model differently than we do~\cite{Wales1987}. Another early approach by Zlotnick is more true to our interpretation of the Building Game, but only considers a single pathway and thus is not concerned with enumeration of the entire combinatorial configuration space~\cite{Zlotnick1994}.

The Building Game contains a wealth of combinatorial enumeration problems. Some have been addressed in the work of Endres et al.~\cite{Endres2005} in which they computed the number of intermediates for each of the Platonic solids. Additionally, the entire combinatorial configuration space for the dodecahedron is illustrated. Before~\cite{Endres2005}, David Wilson enumerated the number of intermediates composed of each number of faces for the icosahedron~\cite{OEIS}. This computation seems to have occurred independent of the scientific context of self-assembly as Wilson's enumerations are referred to as the ``Number of one-sided triangular n-ominoes (or triominoes) on the icosahedron.'' He also includes variants such as the ``Number of triangular n-ominoes on the icosahedron'' which enlarges the equivalence classes to identify intermediate that are reflections of each other. 

\section{New Enumerative Results}

Previous enumeration results for the Building Game have focused on the number of intermediates of the Platonic solids. We extend these results to also count the number of Building Game connections and pathways in the combinatorial configuration space. Additionally, we consider the Platonic, Archimedean, and Catalan solids classes with these results presented in table~\ref{tab:bgEnum}. 

As we consider polyhedra with more and more faces, there is a combinatorial explosion in the number of intermediates in combinatorial configuration space. This was noted in~\cite{Endres2005}, where the dodecahedron has $73$ intermediates and the icosahedron has $2,649$~\cite{Endres2005}. We have enumerated the intermediates for polyhedra of up to $30$ faces in our three classes of polyhedra. The $30$-faced rhombic triacontahdron has the most intermediates of all polyhedra in our computation with $2,423,212$.



%While the 6-faced cube state space has only 8 nodes and 9 nodes, the 20-faced icosahedron state space has 2,649 nodes and 17,241 nodes and the 26-faced truncated cuboctahedron state space has 1,525,605 nodes and 17,672,377. Figure \ref{fig:bgtable} details state space sizes of all polyhedra in the Platonic, Archimedean, and Catalan solid classes of up to 26 faces.

\subsection{Shellability}
The theory of polytopes provides a mathematical method for constructing a polytope called a \textit{shelling}. The process, similar to the Building Game, involves sequentially adding facets of the polytope until all of the facets are added. However, the rules as to which facets may be added at each step of the process are more restrictive. Ziegler provides the following definitions of a polytopal complex, a shelling, and a shellable polytopal complex~\cite{Ziegler1995}. Recall that a polytopal complex is 
\begin{mydef}
\label{def:polycomp}
A (geometric) \textbf{polytopal complex} $\mathcal{C}$ in $\mathbbm{R}^d$ is a collection of polytopes in $\mathbbm{R}^d$ such that 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item the empty set is in $\mathcal{C}$,
\item for any $P \in \mathcal{C}$ all faces of $P$ are in $\mathcal{C}$,
\item the intersection of any two polytopes in $\mathcal{C}$ is a face of both..
\end{enumerate}
If all facets are of the same dimension then $\mathcal{C}$ is \textbf{pure}. 
\end{mydef}

\begin{mydef}
\label{def:shelling}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a pure $k$-dimensional polytopal complex $\mathcal{C}$. A \textbf{shelling} of $\mathcal{C}$ is a linear ordering $F_1,F_2,\dots,F_s$ of the facets of $\mathcal{C}$ such that either $\mathcal{C}$ is $0$-dimensional (and thus the facets are points), or it satisfies the following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item The boundary complex of the first facet $F_1$ has a shelling.
\item For $1 < j \leq s$ the intersection of the facet $F_j$ with the previous facets is non-empty and is a beginning segment of a shelling of the $(k-1)$-dimensional boundary complex of $F_j$, that is,
$$F_j \cap \left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{j-1}F_i\right) = G_1 \cup G_2 \cup \cdots \cup G_r$$
for some shelling $G_1, G_2, \dots, G_r, \dots, G_t$ of $\mathcal{C}(\partial F_j)$, and $1 \leq r \leq t$. (In particular, this requires that $F_j \cap (\bigcup_{i=1}^{j-1} F_i)$ has a shelling, so it has to be a pure $(k-1)$-dimensional, and connected for $k > 1$.)
\end{enumerate} 
\end{mydef}

\begin{mydef}
A polytopal complex is \textbf{shellable} if it is pure and has a shelling. 
\end{mydef}

Since we are only concerned with $3$-dimensional polyhedra, the corresponding polytopal complex simply consists of the faces, edges, and vertices of the polyhedron. The facets of the complex are just the faces.

%\begin{mylem}
%The polytopal complex consisting of the verticies of a edge complex is shellable.
%\end{mylem}
%\begin{proof}
%\end{proof}


\begin{mydef}
A Building Game intermediate $x$ is called a \textbf{shellable intermediate} if for every state $x \in [x]$ there is a linear ordering $f_1, f_2, \dots, f_{|x|}$ on the faces of $x$ such that this ordering is a beginning of a shelling $f_1, f_2, \dots, f_{|x|}, \dots f_{|F|}$ of the polytopal complex $F\cup E\cup V$.
\end{mydef}

\begin{mylem}
The polytopal complex consisting of the edges and vertices of a polygonal face is shellable.
\end{mylem}
\begin{proof}
We see that condition $(i)$ from definition~\ref{def:shelling} is satisfied since the boundary complex of each edge is $0$-dimensional.

Condition $(ii)$ is also satisfied since each newly attached edge and the existing partial shelling is a subset of the attached edge's vertices. Since the vertices of the attached edge are $0$-dimensional, any linear order of its vertices is a shelling.
\end{proof}


%\begin{mythm}
%The poly  
%\end{mythm}

\begin{mydef}
A Building Game connection is said to be a \textbf{shellable connection} if the two connected intermediates are both shellable. A \textbf{shellable pathway} is a Building Game pathway composed entirely of shellable intermediates and connections.
\end{mydef}

Table~\ref{tab:bgEnumShell} details the shellability statistics for the Platonic, Archimedean, and Catalan solids classes. Because of the added shellability restriction, these count statistics are lower than in the general case, but the combinatorial growth as the number of faces increases is similar.  

%\begin{mylem}
%A shelling order cannot be fixed by a polyhedral rotation. 
%\end{mylem}
%\begin{proof}
%\end{proof}

\subsection{Shelling Enumeration}

To our knowledge, the enumeration of the number of shellings of the polyhedra in the Platonic, Archimedean, and Catalan solid classes remains an open problem. Here we present these enumerations for the polyhedra of up to $30$ faces. Since the concept of a shelling is similar to to that of a Building Game pathway, we use the structure of each computed combinatorial configuration space to derive an efficient method for counting the number of shellings of a polyhedron. 

\begin{mythm}
The total number of shellings for a polyhedron is  
\begin{align}
\#(shellings) &= \sum_{\substack{\text{shellable} \\ \text{pathways}: \\ p_1, p_2, \dots, p_{|F|} }}|[x^{p_1}]|\prod_j^{|F|-1}S_{p_jp_{(j+1)}} .
\end{align}
\end{mythm}
\begin{proof}
We use the function that returns whether adding $f_k$ to the existing sub-shelling $f_1,\dots,f_{k-1}$ is itself a sub-shelling and call it $sh(\{f_1,\dots,f_{k-1}\}, f_k)$. Further, a Building Game shellable connection between two intermediates is denoted  $[x^{p_i}] \xrightarrow{sh} [x^{p_{i+1}}]$. Using this notation, we compute the result directly:
\begin{align*}
\#(shellings) &= \sum_{f_1 \in F} \mathbbm{1}_{sh(\emptyset,f_1)} \cdots\sum_{f_k \in F\setminus \{f_1,\dots,f_{k-1}\}} \mathbbm{1}_{sh(\{f_1,\dots,f_{k-1}\}, f_k)} \\
&\hspace{1cm} \cdots \sum_{f_{|F|} \in F\setminus \{f_1, f_2, \dots, f_{|F|-1}\}}\mathbbm{1}_{sh(\{f_1, f_2, \dots, f_{|F|-1}\},f_{|F|})}  \\
&= \sum_{f_1 \in F} \mathbbm{1}_{sh(\emptyset,f_1)} \cdots\sum_{f_k \in F\setminus \{f_1,\dots,f_{k-1}\}} \mathbbm{1}_{sh(\{f_1,\dots,f_{k-1}\}, f_k)} \\
&\hspace{1cm} \cdots \sum_{x^{p_{|F|}}: [x^{p_{|F|-1}}] \xrightarrow{sh} [x^{p_{|F|}}]} S_{p_{|F|-1}p_{|F|}}  \\
&= \sum_{f_1 \in F} \sum_{x^{p_2}: [x^{p_1}] \xrightarrow{sh} [x^{p_2}]} S_{p_{1}p_{2}}  \cdots \sum_{x^{p_{|F|}}: [x^{p_{|F|-1}}] \xrightarrow{sh} [x^{p_{|F|}}]} S_{p_{|F|-1}p_{|F|}}  \\
&= \sum_{[x^{p_1}] : |x^{p_1}| = 1} |[x^{p_1}]| \sum_{x^{p_2}: [x^{p_1}] \xrightarrow{sh} [x^{p_2}]} S_{p_{1}p_{2}}  \cdots \sum_{x^{p_{|F|}}: [x^{p_{|F|-1}}] \xrightarrow{sh} [x^{p_{|F|}}]} S_{p_{|F|-1}p_{|F|}}  \\
&= \sum_{\substack{\text{shellable} \\ \text{pathways}: \\ p_1, p_2, \dots, p_{|F|} }}|[x^{p_1}]|\prod_j^{|F|-1}S_{p_jp_{(j+1)}}. 
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

Using dynamic programming we can compute the number of shellings explicitly without having to explicitly consider each pathway individually. Define the quantity $a_{ik}$ as
\begin{align}
a_{i,k} &\doteq  \sum_{\substack{\text{shellable subpaths}:\\ p_1, \dots, p_k \\ x^{p_k} \in [x^i]}}|G.x^{p_1}|\prod_{j=1}^{k-1}S_{p_j p_{j+1}} \end{align}
where a subpath is the first $k$ intermediates in some valid pathway. Using this definition, we first note that the number of shellings, which is the quantity of interest, is equal to $a_{N,|F|}$ where $x^N = F$. Now, we set up the following recursion that will be the basis for our computation. 
\begin{align}
a_{i,k} &\doteq \sum_{\substack{\text{shellable subpaths}:\\ p_1, \dots, p_k \\ x^{p_k} \in [x^i]}}|G.x^{p_1}|\prod_{j=1}^{k-1}S_{p_j p_{j+1}} \\  
&= \sum_{[x^\ell]:[x^\ell]\xrightarrow{sh}[x^i]} \sum_{\substack{\text{shellable subpaths}:\\ p_1, \dots, p_{k-1} \\ x^{p_{k-1}} \in [x^\ell]}}|G.x^{p_1}|S_{\ell i}\prod_{j=1}^{k-2}S_{p_j p_{j+1}} \\
&= \sum_{[x^\ell]:[x^\ell]\xrightarrow{sh}[x^i]} S_{\ell i} \sum_{\substack{\text{shellable subpaths}:\\ p_1, \dots, p_{k-1} \\ x^{p_{k-1}} \in [x^\ell]}}|G.x^{p_1}|\prod_{j=1}^{k-2}S_{p_j p_{j+1}} \\
&= \sum_{[x^\ell]:[x^\ell]\xrightarrow{sh}[x^i]} S_{\ell i} a_{\ell, k-1}
\end{align}
Thus, using the base cases $a_{j,1} = |G.x^j|$ for each single faced intermediate $[x^j]$, we can use this relation to recursively solve for the number of shellings $a_{N,|F|}$.

\subsection{Bounds and Asymptotics}
There is a clear relation between the number of faces in a polyhedron and then number of intermediates it has. However, that relationship also greatly depends on the polyhedral symmetry group. For instance, if the polyhedron has a small number of faces and a trivial rotation group consisting only of the identity, every edge-connected subset of the polyhedron's faces will be a distinct intermediate. In aggregate, this may mean that the polyhedron has more intermediates than another polyhedron with more faces, yet a larger symmetry group. 

An upper bound on the number of intermediates is possible using the theory of group actions. Consider the set of all subsets $2^F$ of a polyhedron with rotation group $G$. Trivially $|2^F/G|$ is an upper bound on the number of intermediates since it simply relaxes the connectivity requirement for a subset to be a Building Game state. Using Burnside's lemma, we see that 
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:IntUB}
  |2^F/G| &= \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g \in G}|(2^F)^g| \\
  &> \frac{|(2^F)^e|}{|G|} \\
  &= \frac{|2^F|}{|G|} \\
  &= \frac{2^{|F|}}{|G|}
\end{align}
which is not a particularly good bound in practice. The precise value of $|2^F/G|$ is calculable with minimal computer assistance, but details of this computation are omitted due to its relative uselessness. For the cube, the bound is fairly tight, only including the two non-intermediates corresponding to the empty subset of faces, and the non-connected subset consisting of the top and bottom faces. Thus the cube has the bound $|2^F/G| = 10 \geq 8$. In the case of the tetrahedron, the only over-counted subset of faces is the empty one and the bound is $|2^F/G| = 5 \geq 4$. However, in the case of the icosahedron we have $|2^F/G| \geq \frac{2^{20}}{60} \approx 17476.3 \gg 2649$. Here we use the approximate bound $\frac{2^{|F|}}{|G|}$ which is the largely dominant term in the sum from equation~\ref{eq:IntUB}.

We can get a similar bound on the number of intermediates with a particular number of faces,
\begin{align}
  |\{x \in 2^F: |x| = k\} /G| &= \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g \in G}|\{x \in 2^F: |x| = k\}^g| \\
  &> \frac{|\{x \in 2^F: |x| = k\}^e|}{|G|} \\
  &= \frac{|\{x \in 2^F: |x| = k\}|}{|G|} \\
  &= \frac{{|F| \choose k}}{|G|}
\end{align}
but again, this is not particularly useful, especially for intermediates with around $\frac{1}{2}|F|$ faces.

Since the Building Game is similar in spirit to polyomino enumeration, one might try to assimilate some the techniques used for polyominoes. For example, through fairly simple arguments, one can show that $s_ms_n \leq s_{m+n}$ where $s_m$ is the number of unique polyominoes with $m$ subunits~\cite{Klarner1973}. This leads to the bound $s_m \leq (const)^m$. Unfortunately, this approach is cannot be applied to the Building Game as there is a fundamental difference between the two growth models. In the polyomino case, there is no limit to the number of subunits that can be considered. Importantly, this is not the case for the Building Game since an intermediate can only have $|F|$ faces at most. Thus any such recurrence relation for the Building Game will result in a good upper bound for the intermediates with a small number of faces at best.

The formulation of meaningful bounds for the number of Building Game intermediates with $k$ faces remains an open problem, especially for $k \sim \frac{1}{2}|F|$. At the root of the problem is the difficulty in mathematically describing the subsets of $F$ are edge connected. Future approaches may incorporate enumeration results for connected sub-graphs or Hamiltonian paths since these topics explicitly acknowledge connectedness properties. 

From looking at the statistics on number of faces $|F|$ of a polyhedron and the number of intermediates in its combinatorial configuration space, it is natural to want to make statements about the asymptotic growth of the combinatorial configuration space's size. Unfortunately, when formed in this way, the problem is ill-posed. To discuss asymptotics, we must first specify an infinite class of polyhedra. The Platonic, Archimedean, and Catalan Solid classes that we've worked with thus far are all finite though, so other choices must be considered. One option is to take an existing polyhedron in one of these classes and create an infinite family by describing finer and finer tilings on top of the polyhedron's faces. If designed carefully each member of the tiled polyhedron family will have the same symmetry group, even as the number of faces grows. 

%Similar to polyhedra with tiled faces are the icosahedral viral capsids indexed by T-number. This number is related to the number of protein subunits in the virus. When each subunit is idealized as a polygon, a T-capsid will consist of $12$ pentagons and $10(T-1)$ hexagons. Interestingly, this makes most of the icosahedral viral capsid equivalent to the dual of an icosahedron with each face consisting of $T$ triangular tiles. This would certainly be an interesting an relevant family of polyhedra to consider, though we leave it as an open problem.

\section{Computational Methods}

We use a brute force method to compute the combinatorial configuration space and enumerate the intermediates for a particular polyhedron. Computation begins by first enumerating the intermediates with a single face. The results of this enumeration are then used to compute the intermediates with two faces. This process proceeds iteratively until all intermediates are accounted for. Figure~\ref{alg:CCS} outlines the detailed algorithm for this computation. 

At each stage of our algorithm, we know the set of intermediates that have $k$ faces, which we call $A_k$. This information is then used to compute the set of faces with $k+1$ faces, $A_{k+1}$. Since all intermediates in $A_{k+1}$ must be formed by adding a single face to an intermediate from $A_k$, we take each intermediate $[x] \in A_k$ and try adding each face to $x$ that is allowable under the Building Game rules. This means we look at every face $f \in F\setminus x$ and look for another face  $\hat{f} \in x$ such that $f$ and $\hat{f}$ share an edge. For every such face $f$, we look at the new $(k+1)$-faced state $y \doteq x\cup \{f\}$. Since we know that $[y]$ is a Building Game intermediate, it must be represented in $A_{k+1}$, however before adding $y$ to $A_{k+1}$, we must verify that there is no $\hat{y}$ already in $A_{k+1}$ such that $y \in [\hat{y}]$.

The act of comparing two states $y$ and $\hat{y}$ to check if they are members of the same intermediate is the task where the majority of computational time is spent. The brute force method of checking if $y \sim \hat{y}$ involves checking if $g.y = \hat{y}$ for each $g \in G$. If a $g$ is found that makes this equality hold, then $[y] = [ \hat{y}]$ and the computation terminates and we know that $[y]$ is not a new intermediate. In this case, nothing is added to $A_{k+1}$ but a connection $x \leftrightarrow \hat{y}$ is added in the combinatorial configuration space. Furthermore, by tracking how many time a particular connection $x \leftrightarrow \hat{y}$ is found, the forward degeneracy numbers can be computed quickly. 

\subsection{Efficient Congruence Testing}

Similar to the approach of~\cite{Pandey2011}, we implement a hash function $\textswab{h}$ that maps each state to an integer with the property that $[y] = [\hat{y}]$ if and only if $\textswab{h}(y) = \textswab{h}(\hat{y})$. By designing such a function, checking for congruence between two states just amounts to a comparison of the states' hash values. 

Given an enumeration of the polyhedron's faces, each state may be represented by a binary vector giving each face's inclusion or exclusion in the state. The hash we use is the base ten integer corresponding to the minimal binary representation of the state taken over all possible rotations
\begin{align}
\textswab{h}(y) &= \min_{g \in G} \text{int}(g.y).
\end{align} 
While this does require considering each possible rotation for every proposal state, this computation must only be performed once. 

%When checking if two states $y$ and $\hat{y}$ are members of the same intermediate, we first check if $\textswab{h}(y) = \textswab{h}(\hat{y})$. If they do not have the same hash, then they cannot be members of the same intermediate and the check is complete. Alternatively, if they do have identical hashes, it is not a guarantee that they are members of the same intermediate, so the exhastive rotation method must be used. If the hash is carefully designed then this false positive rate ($\textswab{h}(y) = \textswab{h}(\hat{y})$ when $[y] \neq [\hat{y}]$) is small and almost all of the tedious rotation calculations will result in a positive match. 

%In an ideal world, a hash function that also gives the property $[x] = [\hat{x}]$ whenever $\textswab{h}(x) = \textswab{h}(\hat{x})$ would be best. However we have not been able to find such an $\textswab{h}$ that is computable in a relatively reduced amount of time in comparison to the default method. We leave the existence of such a hash as a possibility. 

%Since any hash we choose must a function that maps states that are rotations of each other to the same integer, we look at local connectivity properties. For each face $f_k \in F$ define its local connectivity within $y$ as  $\textswab{h}_k(y) = |\{\hat{f} \in F : \hat{f} \in y, f_k \cap \hat{f} \in E\}|$, the number of faces adjacent to $f_k$ that are also in $y$. Since this connectivity is preserved by rotations, even though we wont necessarily have $\textswab{h}_k(y) = \textswab{h}_k(\hat{y})$ when $[y] = [\hat{y}]$, if we take a histogram of all values of $\textswab{h}_k$ for $k = 1,\dots,|F|$, the histogram will be the same for both $y$ and $\hat{y}$. Once a histogram is computed, the final hash $\textswab{h}$ is just a simple function that maps histograms to integers.

%There are many variants of statistics that this histogram strategy can be used with. We found that taking separate histograms for faces in $y$ and faces not in $y$ provided a hash with less false positives, while only increasing the hash computation time marginally. Depending on the polyhedron, the implementation of this hash lead to an over all speed up of at least an order of magnitude over the naive method.  

\subsection{Data Structures}

Before the computation of the combinatorial configuration space, we hard-code an enumeration $f_1, \dots, f_{|F|}$ of the faces of our polyhedron. Then, any state $x$ is represented by a binary vector of length $|F|$ with a one in the $k$th entry if $f_k \in x$ and zero otherwise. With this convention, each rotation $g \in G$ corresponds to a permutation of the indices of $x$. Each such permutation in the group is precomputed and then applied as necessary when performing a rotational comparison of two states. To track the connectivity structure of the polyhedron, an adjacency list on faces is stored as a two dimensional array. For each face number, the adjacency list specifies the index of adjacent faces.

Each group of $k$-faced intermediates $A_k$ is stored as a hash table using the previously described hash function. This allows for order one look-up of intermediates already in the $A_k$ that match the hash of a new proposal intermediate. 

\subsection{Run Time}

The computing time required to enumerate the combinatorial configuration space is heavily dependent on the number of intermediates that are found. Since we do not have a tight bound on the number of intermediates as a function of simple statistics of the polyhedron (faces, edges, etc.), it is difficult to provide a meaningful estimates on the time required to compute the combinatorial configuration space without explicit knowledge of its size a priori.

That said, we can express an upper bound on the number of state to state comparisons that are required as a function of the intermediate sets $A_1,\dots,A_{|F|}$. 

\begin{align}
\#\text{comparisons} &\leq \sum_{k=1}^{|F|-1} \sum_{x \in A_k} \sum_{f \in F\setminus x} \sum_{\hat{y} \in A_{k+1}} 1 \\
&\leq |F|\sum_{k=1}^{|F|-1}|A_k||A_{k+1}| 
%&\leq |F|\sum_{k=1}^{|F|-1} {|F| \choose k} {|F| \choose k+1}  \\
\end{align}


\subsection{Implementation}
All computation was carried out on a desktop computer running 64-bit Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with 15.6 GiB memory and a quad-core 3.20GHz Intel processor. To compute the Building Game combinatorial configurations space, we developed C++ code with the help of the Boost graph library for storing the connectivity structure. Computation of the combinatorial configuration space took less than a minute for most polyhedra, though--as expected--this time grew dramatically with the number of faces. Our largest case, the 30-faced Rhombic Triacontahedron took on the order of 10 minutes to compute. 

Additional computation--especially for pathway and shelling statistics--was completed using Python and the mpmath module for arbitrary precision arithmetic~\cite{mpmath}.
